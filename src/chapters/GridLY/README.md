# GridLY

One of the most interesting libraries in [openlilylib][] is [GridLY][], which
implements the approach described in [The "Segment Grid" Approach][] by Urs
Liska with some ideas from [Trees, Music and LilyPond][] by Jan-Peter Voigt.

The basic idea is to divide multipart scores into many independent cells, where
the conceptual rows are the usual divisions of parts and the columns are
segments of time.
