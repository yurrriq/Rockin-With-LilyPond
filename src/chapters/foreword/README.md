# Foreword

Writing this book has been in the back of my mind for at least a decade now.

I started engraving scores with LilyPond in high school and was immediately
hooked. At the time, tools like Finale were prohibitively expensive, and
alternatives like MuseScore produced less-than-ideal results. Plus, I was
already a $\LaTeX$ lover and Schemer, so LilyPond was an obvious choice. Since
then, I've engraved hundreds of scores and even written programs that generate
them.

While my primary instrument is the piano (at least according to my degree), I
also write songs for and play the guitar. My memory is chaotic and often spotty,
and note-taking is purportedly great for reinforcing memory, so in an effort to
remember [my band][Naptaker]'s songs, I would often write scores with
LilyPond. In doing so, I cobbled together loads of tips and tricks from across
the internet. LilyPond does support various instrumentation and notation
systems, but most of the literature seems to cater to choral, piano, or
orchestral music.

In this book, I'll share what I've learned over the years, in the hope that
others might benefit and engrave beautiful scores for rock band arrangements.
